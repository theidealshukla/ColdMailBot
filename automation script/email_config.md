Dear {hr_name},

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Adarsh Kumar Shukla, and I’m currently a pre-final year B.Tech Computer Science student. I came across {company}’s work and would love the chance to explore internship opportunities with your team.

A little about me:

-Built an AI-driven customer support portal (with tracking, authentication, and RCA/CAPA suggestions)

-Developed a responsive news website with dynamic content loading

-Hands-on experience with JavaScript, React, Firebase, Supabase, and Python

I’m excited about the possibility of contributing to {company}, while also learning and growing under the guidance of your team. Please let me know if we could connect further about potential opportunities.

Looking forward to your response,
Adarsh Kumar Shukla
